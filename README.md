# Loading Skeleton

This is a flutter package that provides you a loading animated and customizable widget.

## Installation

Here you will see everything you need to install and use this package.

To install it, paste this code into your *pubspec.yaml* under dependencies:

## Getting started

With **loading skeleton** all you need is set a width and a height:

and the result:

If you want to be more creative you can change more things like:

    * Margin;
    * Colors;
    * The animation duration;
    * Where the animation should end on the y axis;
    * And of course you can add a child widget to it and add anything you want.

Let's check an example that use all of this parameters:
