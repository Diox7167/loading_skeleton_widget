# Loading Skeleton

This is a flutter package that provides you a loading animated and customizable widget.

## Getting Started

Here you will see everything you need to know to install and use **loading skeleton**.

To install this package, paste this code into your *pubspec.yaml*:
```
    loading_skeleton: {version_number}
```
and then run `flutter pub get` and that's it!

With **loading skeleton** all you need is set a width and a height:

```
LoadingSkeleton(
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        )
```
and the result:

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
